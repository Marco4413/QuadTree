# QuadTree

This project is a simple QuadTree implementation using Vanilla JavaScript and no dependencies.

## Examples

There's a small example that can be viewed at [Marco4413.github.io/QuadTree/examples](https://Marco4413.github.io/QuadTree/examples).
The keybinds are the following:
 - Scroll Wheel : Zoom in and out.
 - Ctrl + Left Click Drag : Move the camera around.
 - Shift + Left Click Drag : Will create an area that will be queried to highlight the elements from the overlapped zones.
 - Ctrl + Left Click : Will highlight the clicked zone and its elements.
 - Left Click : Creates a new element at the mouse cursor.
 - 1,2,3 : Selects a shape between a Point, a Circle and a Rectangle (The last two can overlap more than one zone!).
